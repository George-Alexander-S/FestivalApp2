This repo is now public as the assigment has been delivered

This website "app" is for my exam in Data Visualization.
It's built as a React.js project, which is not part of my curriculum,
however I figured it would be a fun experience seeing as I've been curious about react.js.

The design is for mobile only, to make it "appy".
